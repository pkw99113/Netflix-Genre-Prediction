# Netflix-Genre-Prediction
Predicting Netflix show genres using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

## Dataset
- Netflix Titles Dataset (8,000+ entries)
- [Source: Kaggle Netflix Titles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## Project Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw Netflix data
- Engineered "main genre" feature from multi-label columns
- Label-encoded categorical features
- Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- Improved genre prediction accuracy from 27% (Logistic Regression) to 47% (Decision Tree)
- Visualized:
  - Genre distribution
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Feature Importances

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Future Improvements
- Try Random Forest, XGBoost models
- Feature engineering from text descriptions
- Hyperparameter tuning for Decision Trees
